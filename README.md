# Banking-System
## Introduction
The Banking System Project is a Python-based application that simulates a basic banking system. The project aims to provide users with a simple banking experience by allowing them to log in, deposit and withdraw funds, check their balance, and perform other essential banking tasks.

The project demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts and data structures to create a functional banking system that can be used as a starting point for more complex applications.
